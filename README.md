# Contained Files  
The repository contains the _Project2.Rmd_, _Project2.html_, and _Issued_Construction_permits_20241102.csv_ files.  
The **Project2.Rmd** file contains the code for the project.  
The **Project2.html** file contains the html view of the base project. This file will not be modified until the code in the Rmd is changed and the file is knit.  
The **Issued_Construction_permits_20241102.csv** file is the csv that contains the data. This is directly what the permits dataframe reads into.
